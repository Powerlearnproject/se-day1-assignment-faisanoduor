#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    software engineering is imploying engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems.
    Software engineering  enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce,     entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    1. Structured Programming 1960 -1970. improved code clarity and reduced complexity.
    2. Object-oriented Programming 1980s. focused more on objects rather than actions.
    3. Agile Methodologies 2000. emphasized flexibility, and collaboration and allowed users to adapt to change quicker.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    1. Requirement -Collecting and documenting user demands and system requirements.
    2. Design -Developing high-level and comprehensive designs for the software architecture and user interface.
    3. implementation -building the software according to the design specifications.
    4. Testing- having to do various trials to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
    5. Deployment - Launching the software
    6. Maintenace - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    
     Waterfall methodology follows a strict phase-by-phase process, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. Large-scale government projects,     manufacturing, and regulated industries systems.

    Agile is an iterative and progressive method of software development. It stresses adaptability, cooperation, and customer feedback, allowing teams to deliver small, useful bits of software regularly. can be used to aid startups, web and mobile applications, and product development in fast-moving markets.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

      a Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions

        Quality Assurance Engineer:  Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

     Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a comprehensive suite of tools that facilitate software development i.e Visual Studio, Pycharm

     Version Control Systems are tools that help a developer manage changes  to a source code overtime and also track the team's history

    Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    
    Changing Requirements requirements may change during the development cycle, resulting in scope creep and project delays.
    Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
    Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

    To overcome such challenges a developer is required to employ effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  
    - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
    - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
    - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
    - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

    Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

    Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting, refining, and optimizing input queries  to interact effectively with AI models like GPT. 

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Vague prompt: how do i do it?

    specific: add a topic like what you want to know how to do.
    clear: go straight to the point i.e how to make sales
    concise: ensure the prompt has enough info i.e how to sell a book


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
